# What is the duration of a growing perpetuity?
This repo is a short one. This is to store a simple derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity, as I have yet to see a simple, readily-available answer to the question "what is the duration of a growing perpetuity?" Posting here in the hopes that someone finds this useful one day.

Version as [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/duration_of_growing_perpetuity/blob/main/simple_duration_of_growing_perpetuity.ipynb) and [HTML](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/duration_of_growing_perpetuity/blob/main/simple_duration_of_growing_perpetuity.html).
