# What is the duration of a growing perpetuity?
This repo is a short one. This is to store a simple derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity, as I have yet to see a simple, readily-available answer to the question "what is the duration of a growing perpetuity?" I aimed to keep it short and to the point. Posting here in the hopes that someone finds this useful one day.
